MVP for Friday 2/10/17

Web-based photo messaging app, with unique quasi-private group messaging/sharing

What does it do?
- Groups of people (called a `Family`)

Family members can send message to all Family members

But, each message is separated from the others:
- Reply from one person not visible by the others
- Original sender sees all replies, can continue 'thread' with that person

Gallery feature
- grid view of all sent/received photos for that person
- ??? one grid same for all Family?
- For MVP -- there's only one, but later def. need to only see photos you sent/received


Week 2:
Grid Gallery
- filtering of images on people/sender/date/etc.

User perspective:
- User authentication -- use Google Auth (at least for now)
- User can upload photo and send to Family
